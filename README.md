<h1>Challenge your FdF</h1>


You think your FdF is good?<br>
Try these tests to see how good you are!<br>
I used FdF (github.com/VBrazhnik/FdF) for visualization because mine has readable buffer restrictions <br>

<h2>The first test is a 500x500  Aka Julia card</h2>

<h2>The second test is the 1000x1000 card, and it's not that easy.</h2>

<h2>The final test is a 5000x5000 map, a peak that few people will reach, but if you're running it, I'll take my hat off to you</h2>
